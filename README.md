# Desk_ino

## Personal project with arduino using different sensors

My goal is to create a desk gadget using Arduino Uno R4.

The sensors i will use are: 

- motion sensor: in order to turn on a series of led to light on my desk for a few seconds
- photoresistor: in order to prevent the leds turning on when the main light source in my room is on
